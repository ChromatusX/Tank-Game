## Each tank has three lives. There are two type of power ups. One is full heal but can only be use if health is not already full. The other one is damage boost which increases damage and is stackable. Damage resets when respawn. 

## So far there are two maps and it is randomize on which map upon running the program. The first map is meant to be a normal arena whereas the second map is meant to be faster pace.


## Note: The location where the bullet comes out from is a bit off.
## Note: There is no collision between the tanks themself. 
## Note: Very few time where breaking the breakable wall would crash the game.
## Note: The green color around the tank counts as the hitbox.
## Note: There is currently no sound at all.
## Note: Once the victory message shows, you have to close the window to restart.
